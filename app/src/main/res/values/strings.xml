    <string name="intro">You find yourself in a dark forest. Alone. Cold. The wind howls through
        the trees…at least you hope it was the wind. To your left, a yellow light shines in the
        distance. Maybe a fire. Too far to make out any real details. To your right, you hear a
        river flowing and what sounds like a woman singing.</string>
    <string name="optionA">Go left toward the light.</string>
    <string name="optionB">Go right toward the singing.</string>
    <string name="optionAScenario">As you near the light, you see that it isn’t coming from a fire,
        but a lantern. An old man sits in front of it with his hands outstretched as if he were
        trying to warm them by it. You approach carefully and stop just outside of the arms
        of the lantern’s glow.</string>
    <string name="optionBScenario">The woman’s voice grows clearer with each passing step and the
        clearer it becomes the harder it is for you to pull yourself away from it. You suddenly
        find yourself standing on the bank of a dark river. In the middle of the river, a woman
        in a white dress stands seemingly unbothered by her surroundings.</string>
    <string name="optionC">Step into the light.</string>
    <string name="optionD">Go back toward the river.</string>
