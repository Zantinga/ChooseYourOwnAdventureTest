    <string name="intro">You find yourself in a dark forest. Alone. Cold. The wind howls through
        the trees…at least you hope it was the wind. To your left, a yellow light shines in the
        distance. Maybe a fire. Too far to make out any real details. To your right, you hear a
        river flowing and what sounds like a woman singing.</string>
    <string name="optionA">Go left toward the light.</string>
    <string name="optionB">Go right toward the singing.</string>
    <string name="optionAScenario">As you near the light, you see that it isn’t coming from a fire,
        but a lantern. An old man sits in front of it with his hands outstretched as if he were
        trying to warm them by it. You approach carefully and stop just outside of the arms
        of the lantern’s glow.</string>
    <string name="optionBScenario">The woman’s voice grows clearer with each passing step and the
        clearer it becomes the harder it is for you to pull yourself away from it. You suddenly
        find yourself standing on the bank of a dark river. In the middle of the river, a woman
        in a white dress stands seemingly unbothered by her surroundings.</string>
    <string name="optionC">Step into the light.</string>
    <string name="optionD">Go back toward the river.</string>
    <string name="optionE">Call out to the woman.</string>
    <string name="optionF">Go back toward the light.</string>
    <string name="optionCScenario">The old man doesn’t seem to notice you as you emerge from the
        darkness and take a seat beside him. Awkwardly, you extend your hands to the lantern, but
        feel no warmth so you retract them. Several moments pass before the old man asks you your
        name without ever really looking at you.</string>
    <string name="optionG">I can\'t remember.</string>
    <string name="optionH">(lie) James.</string>
    <string name="optionDScenario">A wave of uneasiness washes over you as you watch the old man
        in the dim light of the lantern. Suddenly, you have an urge to run, but you don’t. Instead
        you turn around slowly and proceed toward the river where you thought you heard singing.
        Singing seems safer than a strange old man by a lantern.</string>
