    <string name="intro">You find yourself in a dark forest. Alone. Cold. The wind howls through
        the trees…at least you hope it was the wind. To your left, a yellow light shines in the
        distance. Maybe a fire. Too far to make out any real details. To your right, you hear a
        river flowing and what sounds like a woman singing.</string>
    <string name="optionA">Go left toward the light.</string>
    <string name="optionB">Go right toward the singing.</string>
    <string name="optionAScenario">As you near the light, you see that it isn’t coming from a fire,
        but a lantern. An old man sits in front of it with his hands outstretched as if he were
        trying to warm them by it. You approach carefully and stop just outside of the arms
        of the lantern’s glow.</string>
